      <description>The character designs were provided by the course, and I decided to design my own background for the second and third animation seen in the video above. Included below are looping gifs of the frame-by-frame rough passes for each assignment&#xA;Out of 10 animal designs to choose from for this assignment, I thought that the owl and kangaroo could have an interesting jump and float transitional movement&#xA;Wanted to do a walk cycle where the character switches to walking backwards for a bit, and then spins around to face forward again</description>
